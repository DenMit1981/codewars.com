//Almost every company has a specific acronym for each employee, which is the first letter of their first and last name.
//Your task is to write an acronym generator that generates an acronym for a given name.
//You don't have to worry about repeating acronyms (someone else will do that for you).
//Note that names can be in both upper and lower case.
//The acronym should always be upper case.
//Usually, the acronym is always the first letter of your first name and the first letter of your last name, all in
//upper case.
//For example:
//Thomas Meyer => TM
//Martin Schmidt => MS
//Your company only employs people with a maximum of two first names. If a person has two first names, they can be
//connected with a dash.
//Jan-Erich Schmidt => JES Jan Erich MÃ¼ller => JEM
//Surnames can also be connected with a dash. No one can have more than two surnames.
//Paul Meyer-Schmidt
//In Germany, there are surnames in which the leading word is "von". This is abbreviated with a lowercase "v":
//Paul von Lahnstein => PvL
//Martin von Lahnstein-Mayer => MvLM
